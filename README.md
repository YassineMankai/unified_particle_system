### Building and Running

This project was made in the context of the computer animation's course  or "Xinf585" taken in Ã©cole polytechnique. The base code is a combination of labs that we did in class. We used a library provided by our professor "Damien rohmer" called CGP, that provide solid grounds for implementing computer animation's features.
